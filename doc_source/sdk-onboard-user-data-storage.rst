Add Data Storage to your App

.. _sdk-onboard-mobile-user-data-storage-steps:

In this section, we will walk you through a step by step process to setup an S3 bucket, setup authentication for your app and upload/download a file.
We will use Cognito Identity Pools for Authentication, which will provide a set of short-lived access credentials to your app.

Setup the Backend
==================

If you already have a Cognito Identity Pool and have set up its unauthenticated role to have read/write permissions on the S3 bucket, you can skip to the section titled :ref:create-aws-configuration

Create or import the Amazon Cognito Identity Pool
--------------------------------------------------

* Go to `Amazon Cognito Console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito>`__ and choose **Manage Federated Identities**.

* Click **Create new Identity pool** button on the top left of the console.

* Give a name for the Identity pool and check **Enable access to unauthenticated identities** under the **Unauthenticated Identities** section, click **Create pool** button on the bottom right.

* To enable Cognito Identities to access your resources, expand the **View Details** section to see the two roles that are to be created. Make a note of the **unauth** role whose name is of the form **Cognito_<IdentityPoolName>Unauth_Role**. You will need this value at later point in this exercise. Now click **Allow** button in the bottom right of the console to create the roles.

* Under **Get AWSCredentials** section, in the code snippet to create **CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider**, find the Identity pool ID and the AWS region and make note of them. You will need it later.

Set up the required Amazon IAM permissions
-------------------------------------------

* Go to `Amazon IAM Console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home>`__ and select **Roles**.

* Select the **unauth** role you just created in the previous step, which is of the form **Cognito_<IdentityPoolName>Unauth_Role**.

* Select **Attach Policy**, then find **AmazonS3FullAccess** and select it. Click **Attach Policy** button to attach it to the role.

* Note:  This will grant users in the identity pool full access to all buckets and operations in S3. In a real app, you should restrict users to only have access to the resources they need.

Create or import your existing Amazon S3 bucket
------------------------------------------------

* Go to `Amazon S3 Console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home>`__ and click **Create bucket**.

* Enter a name for the bucket that is DNS-compliant, for example `com.amazon.mybucket`. See `Bucket Restrictions and Limitations <hhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html#bucketnamingrules>`__ for more information on how to name buckets.

* Choose the region that you want the bucket to be created.

* Click **Create** to create the bucket. Note the name of the bucket and the region that it was created in. The region typically would be of the form `US East (N. Virginia)`. Use the information on `AWS Regions and Endpoints <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ to map that to a string of the form `us-east-1`. Note down this region string. You will need it later.

.. _create-aws-configuration:

Create AWSConfiguration
========================

Create the awsconfiguration.json file
---------------------------------------

* Create a file with name **awsconfiguration.json** with the following contents:

	.. code-block:: json

		{
		    "UserAgent": "MobileHub\/1.0",
		    "Version": "1.0",
		    "CredentialsProvider": {
		        "CognitoIdentity": {
		            "Default": {
		                "PoolId": "COGNITO-IDENTITY-POOL-ID",
		                "Region": "COGNITO-IDENTITY-POOL-REGION"
		            }
		        }
		    },
		    "S3TransferUtility": {
		        "Default": {
		            "Bucket": "S3-BUCKET-NAME",
		            "Region": "S3-REGION"
		        }
		    }
		}

* Replace the `COGNITO-IDENTITY-POOL-ID` with the Cognito Identity Pool ID.

* Replace the `COGNITO-IDENTITY-POOL-REGION` with the region the Cognito Identity Pool was created in.

* Replace the `S3-BUCKET-NAME` with the name of the S3 bucket.

* Replace the `S3-REGION` with the region the S3 bucket was created in.


Add the awsconfiguration.json file to your app
-----------------------------------------------

.. container:: option

    Android-Java
    	Place the `awsconfiguration.json` file you created in the previous step into a `res/raw` `Android Resource Directory <https://developer.android.com/studio/write/add-resources.html>`__ in your Android project.

    iOS-Swift
    	Place the `awsconfiguration.json` into the folder containing your `Info.plist` file in your Xcode project. Select `Copy items` if needed and `Create groups` in the options dialog to make sure the file is actually copied into the Xcode project.


Add the SDK to your App
========================

.. include:: storage/add-aws-mobile-user-data-storage-connect-to-your-backend.rst

Now, you have setup the backend and added the AWS Mobile SDK to your app. Next, let's look at how we upload and download a file.

.. include:: storage/add-aws-mobile-user-data-storage-upload-download.rst
