About Hosting and Streaming
===========================

The AWS Mobile :ref:`Hosting and Streaming <hosting-and-streaming>` feature is especially useful to web developers. It uses the ability of `Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Introduction.html>`__ buckets to statically host content and the `Amazon CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html>`__ content distribution network (CDN) to host on an endpoint close to every user globally. Amazon CloudFront endpoints can also stream media content.

**About the Hosting and Streaming Sample App**

When you enable Hosting and Streaming , |AMH| provisions content in the root of your
source bucket which includes a local copy of the |JSBlong|
(:file:`aws-min.js`).


* :file:`aws-sdk.min.js` - An |JSBlong| source file.

* :file:`aws-config.js,`- A web app configuration file that is generated to contain constants for the endpoints for each |AMH| feature you have enabled for this project.

* `index.html` - Which uses a constant formed in :file:`aws-config.js` to request and display an AWS guest (unauthenticated) user identity ID from the |COG| service.

When you enable Hosting and Streaming an |CFlong| global content delivery network (CDN)
distribution is created and associated with your bucket. When |AMH| propagates the sample
web app content to the bucket, the content is then propagated to the CDN and becomes
available from local endpoints around the globe. If you configure `CloudFront streaming
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Tutorials.html>`__, then media content you upload to your |S3| bucket can be streamed from
those endpoints.

** To view the Hosting and Streaming Sample App

The |AMH| Hosting and Streaming feature creates a sample JavaScript web app that
demonstrates connecting to the AWS resources of your |AMH| project.

The sample app web assets are deployed to an |S3| bucket. The bucket is configured to host
static web content for public access.


#. In the `Mobile Hub console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/home/>`__, open your project and then choose the Hosting and Streaming tile.

#. Choose :guilabel:`View from S3`.

   This opens a browser and displays the :file:`index.html` of the sample web app from the |S3| bucket.

Configure a Custom Domain for Your Web App
==========================================

 To use your custom domain for linking to your Web app, use the |R53| service to configure DNS
 routing.

 For a web app hosted in a single location, see `Routing Traffic to a Website that Is Hosted in
 an Amazon S3 Bucket <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/RoutingToS3Bucket.html>`__.

 For a web app distributed through a global CDN, see `Routing Traffic to an Amazon CloudFront
 Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloud-fron-distribution.html>`__
