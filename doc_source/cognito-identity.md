## What is Amazon Cognito Identity?<a name="what-is-amazon-cognito-identity"></a>

Using Amazon Cognito Identity, you can create unique identities for your users and authenticate them for secure access to your AWS resources like Amazon S3 or Amazon DynamoDB\. Amazon Cognito Identity supports public identity providers—Amazon, Facebook, Twitter/Digits, Google, or any OpenID Connect\-compatible provider—as well as unauthenticated identities\. Cognito also supports developer authenticated identities, which let you register and authenticate users using your own backend authentication process, while still using [Amazon Cognito Sync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-sync.html) to synchronize user data and access AWS resources\.

For more information on Cognito Identity, see the [Amazon Cognito Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html)\.

For information about Cognito Authentication Region availability, see [Amazon Cognito Identity Region Availability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cognito_identity_region)\.
