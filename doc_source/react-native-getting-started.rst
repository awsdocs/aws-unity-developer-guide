.. _react-native-getting-started_overview:

Overview
========

The AWS Mobile CLI provides a command line experience that allows frontend JavaScript developers to quickly create and integrate AWS backend resources into their mobile apps.

.. _react-native-getting-started_prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

#. `Sign up for the AWS Free Tier <https://aws.amazon.com/free/>`__ to learn and prototype at little or no cost.

#. Install `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`__ with NPM.

#. Install the AWS Mobile CLI

   .. code-block:: bash

       npm install --global awsmobile-cli

#. Configure the CLI with your AWS credentials

   To setup permissions for the toolchain used by the CLI, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      awsmobile configure

   If prompted for credentials, follow the steps provided by the CLI. For more information, see :ref:`Provide IAM credentials to AWS Mobile CLI <aws-mobile-cli-credentials>`.


.. _react-native-getting-started-create-or-integrate:

Set Up Your Backend
===================

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1

   * - Need to create a quick sample React Native app? See `Create a React Native App <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html>`__.

**To configure backend features for your app**

#. In the root folder of your app, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

        awsmobile init

   The :code:`init` command creates a backend project for your app. By default, analytics and web hosting are enabled in your backend and this configuration is automatically pulled into your app when you initialize.

#. When prompted, provide the source directory for your project. The CLI will generate :file:`aws-exports.js` in this location. This file contains the configuration and endpoint metadata used to link your frontend to your backend services.

   .. code-block:: bash

      ? Where is your projects's source directory:  /


   Then respond to further prompts with the following values.

   .. code-block:: bash

      Please tell us about your project:
      ? Where is your project's source directory:  /
      ? Where is your project's distribution directory that stores build artifacts:  build
      ? What is your project's build command:  npm run-script build
      ? What is your project's start command for local test run:  npm run-script start

â€¨.. _react-native-getting-started-configure-aws-amplify:

Connect to Your Backend
=======================


AWS Mobile uses the open source `AWS Amplify library <https://github.com/aws/aws-amplify>`__ to link your code to the AWS features configured for your app.

**To connect the app to your configured AWS services**

#. Install AWS Amplify for React Native library.

   .. code-block:: bash

       npm install --save aws-amplify


#. In :file:`App.js` (or in other code that runs at launch-time), add the following imports.

   .. code-block:: javascript

        import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';

        import aws_exports from './YOUR-PATH-TO/aws-exports';

#. Then add the following code.

   .. code-block:: javascript

        Amplify.configure(aws_exports);


Run Your App Locally
--------------------

Your app is now ready to launch and use the default services configured by AWS Mobile.

**To launch your app locally**

Use the command native to the React Native tooling you are using. For example, if you made your app using :code:`create-react-native-app` then run:

.. code-block:: bash

    npm run android

    # OR

    npm run ios

Anytime you launch your app, :ref:`app usage analytics are gathered and can be visualized<react-native-add-analytics>` in an AWS console.

   * - AWS Free Tier

     - Initializing your app or adding features through the CLI will cause AWS services to be configured on your behalf. The `pricing for AWS Mobile services <http://aws.amazon.com/mobile/pricing>`__ enables you to learn and prototype at little or no cost using the `AWS Free Tier <http://aws.amazon.com/free>`__.
