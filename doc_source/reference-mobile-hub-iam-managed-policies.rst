Control Access to Mobile Hub Projects
#####################################


This section describes how to control access to your projects using the
:guilabel:`AWSMobileHub_FullAccess` and :guilabel:`AWSMobileHub_ReadOnly` AWS managed policies
provided by |AMH|.

To understand how |AMH| uses |IAM| policies attached to the :guilabel:`MobileHub_Service_Role` to
create and modify services on your behalf, see :ref:`reference-mobile-hub-iam-service-role`.

To understand |IAMlong| (|IAM|) in more detail, see :ref:`reference-mobile-hub-iam-auth-access` and
:ref:`reference-mobile-hub-iam-auth-access`.

.. _aws-account-security-recommendations:

Create an IAM User for Better AWS Account Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


To provide better security, we recommend that you do not use your AWS root account to access |AMH|.
Instead, create an |IAMlong| (|IAM|) user, or use an existing |IAM| user, in your AWS account and
then access |AMH| with that user. For more information, see `AWS Security Credentials
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html>`__ in the AWS General Reference.

If you signed up for AWS but have not created an |IAM| user for yourself, you can create one by
using the |IAM| console. First, create an |IAM| administrator group, then create and assign a new
|IAM| user to that group.

.. note:: Before any |IAM| user within an account can create a mobile Hub project, a user with
   administrative privileges for the account must navigate to the `Mobile Hub console
   <https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/>`__ and create an initial project. This step provides
   confirmation that |AMH| can manage AWS services on your behalf.

   To learn more about assigning access rights to |IAM| users or groups, see
   :ref:`reference-mobile-hub-iam-auth-access`.


**To create an |IAM| administrators group**

#. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the |IAM| console at
   `http://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/ <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/>`__

#. In the navigation pane, choose :guilabel:`Groups`, and then choose :guilabel:`Create New Group`.

#. For :guilabel:`Group Name`, type a name for your group, such as :guilabel:`Administrators`, and
   then choose :guilabel:`Next Step`.

#. In the list of policies, select the check box next to the :guilabel:`AdministratorAccess` policy.
   You can use the :guilabel:`Filter` menu and the :guilabel:`Search` box to filter the list of
   policies.

#. Choose :guilabel:`Next Step`, and then choose :guilabel:`Create Group`. Your new group is listed
   under :guilabel:`Group Name`.

The following procedure describes how to create an |IAM| user for yourself, add the user to the
administrators group, and create a password for the user.


**To add an |IAM| user to your group and assign a password**

#. In the navigation pane, choose :guilabel:`Users`, and then choose :guilabel:`Create New Users`.

#. In box :guilabel:`1`, type a user name. Clear the check box next to :guilabel:`Generate an access
   key for each user`. Then choose :guilabel:`Create`.

#. In the list of users, choose the name (not the check box) of the user you just created. You can
   use the :guilabel:`Search` box to search for the user name.

#. In the :guilabel:`Groups` section, choose :guilabel:`Add User to Groups`.

#. Select the check box next to the administrators group. Then choose :guilabel:`Add to Groups`.

#. Scroll down to the :guilabel:`Security Credentials` section. Under :guilabel:`Sign-In
   Credentials`, choose :guilabel:`Manage Password`.

#. Select :guilabel:`Assign a custom password`. Then type a password in the :guilabel:`Password` and
   :guilabel:`Confirm Password` boxes. When you are finished, choose :guilabel:`Apply`.


.. _mobilehub-policies:

AWS Managed (Predefined) Policies for |AMH| Project Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |IAMlong| service controls user permissions for AWS services and resources. Specific permissions
are required in order to view and modify configuration for any project with |AMHlong|. These
permissions have been grouped into the following managed policies, which you can attach to an |IAM|
user, role, or group.

* **AWSMobileHub_FullAccess**

  This policy provides read and write access to |AMHlong| projects. Users with this policy attached
  to their |IAM| user, role, or group are allowed to create new projects, modify configuration for
  existing projects, and delete projects and resources. This policy also includes all of the
  permissions that are allowed under the :code:`AWSMobileHub_ReadOnly` managed policy. After you
  sign in to the Mobile Hub console and create a project, you can use the following link to view
  this policy and the IAM identities that are attached to it.

  `http://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSMobileHub_FullAccess
  <http://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSMobileHub_FullAccess>`__

* **AWSMobileHub_ReadOnly**

  This policy provides read-only access to |AMHlong| projects. Users with this policy attached to
  their |IAM| user, role, or group are allowed to view project configuration and generate sample
  quick start app projects that can be downloaded and built on a developer's desktop (e.g., in
  Android Studio or Xcode). This policy does not allow modification to |AMH| project configuration,
  and it does not allow the user to enable the use of |AMHlong| in an account where it has not
  already been enabled. After you sign in to the Mobile Hub console and create a project, you can
  use the following link to view this policy and the IAM identities that are attached to it.

  `http://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSMobileHub_ReadOnly
  <http://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSMobileHub_ReadOnly>`__


.. _console-readonly:

Viewing the Mobile Hub Console with Read-only Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your |IAM| user, role, or group has read-only permissions for use in an |AMHlong| project, then
the project information you see in the console will not reflect any changes made outside of |AMH|.
For example, if you remove a Cloud Logic API in |ABP|, it may still be present in the Cloud Logic
Functions list of your |AMH| project, until a user with :code:`mobilehub:SynchronizeProject`
permissions visits the console. Users who are granted console access through the
:code:`AWSMobileHub_FullAccess` policy have those permissions. If you need additional permissions in
Mobile Hub, please contact your administrator and request the Full Access policy.


.. _attach-managed-policy:

Attaching a Managed Policy to a User, Role, or Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use these managed policies, a user with administrative privileges must attach one of them to a
user, role or group in the |IAMlong| console.


**To attach a managed policy**

#. Choose the link for the managed policy you want to attach.

   * `http://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSMobileHub_FullAccess
     <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSMobileHub_FullAccess>`__
   * `http://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSMobileHub_ReadOnly
     <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSMobileHub_ReadOnly>`__

#. Choose :guilabel:`Attached Entities`.

#. Choose :guilabel:`Attach`.

#. Choose the users, roles, or groups you want to grant permissions.

#. Choose :guilabel:`Attach Policy`.
