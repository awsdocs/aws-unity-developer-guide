Feature Details
===============


The following image shows Conversational Bots using |LEXlong| to add natural language to a mobile

.. image:: images/diagram-abstract-conversational-bots.png

|AMHlong| conversational bots bring your mobile app the same natural language understanding and
business logic integration that power the Amazon Alexa and Amazon Shopping voice and text
conversation experiences.

|AMH| conversational bots use Amazon Lex, an AWS service for building voice and text conversational
interfaces into applications. Amazon Lex has built-in integration with |LAM|.

With conversational bots and Amazon Lex, no deep learning expertise is necessary. Specify the basic
conversation flow in the Amazon Lex console to create a bot. The service manages the dialogue and
dynamically adjusts the responses in the conversation. Using Mobile Hub conversation bots, you can
provision and test bots based on demonstration templates or bots you have created in the Amazon Lex
console. |AMH| provides integration instructions and customized components for reusing the sample
app code we generate in your own app.
