|AMH| Project Export Format

.. meta::
   :description: Details of how |AMHlong| project configurations can be exported as a YAML file and
      then imported to create a new project with a configuration that matches the original.


|AMHlong| provides the ability to export a YAML file containing the configuration of your project.
The YAML file itself can be imported or it can be included in a :file:`.zip` file with other project
components that get deployed during project import. This section describes the anatomy of the YAML
and a typical |AMH| project export :file:`.zip` file. For more information about the |AMH|
Import/Export feature, see :ref:`project-import-export`.

Structure of a Project Export .zip File
=======================================


When you choose :guilabel:`Export (file)`, |AMH| generates a :file:`.zip` file named for your
project.

Default file structure

    Mobile Hub also generates a :file:`mobile-hub-project.yml` project configuration file in the :file:`.zip` root. A valid :file:`mobile-hub-project.yml` file in this location is required for Mobile Hub project import to succeed.

Example file structure

    File structure of the :file:`.zip` file an exported project, configured to include deployment of both SAML federation and Cloud Logic API handlers, is as follows:

    * :file:`{/your-project-name}.zip`


      * :file:`mobile-hub-project.yml`

      * :file:`saml.xml`

      * :file:`lambda API handler functions`

      * :file:`user data stored files`

      * :file:`hosted files`

Files in a project export :file:`.zip` file can be arranged in folders. The relative paths within
the archive must be reflected in the project definition YAML key values that refer to their paths.

.. note:: The presence of any files or folders in the project configuration :file:`.zip` file, other
   than those described in the preceding section, may be ignored or cause issues upon import.

Structure of a Project Export .yml File
=======================================


In the abstract, the basic structure of a |AMH| project export :file:`.yml` file is as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    features:
        FEATURE-TYPE: !com.amazonaws.mobilehub.v0.:FEATURE-TYPE
              components:
                FEATURE-NAME: !com.amazonaws.mobilehub.v0.FEATURE-TYPE
                    attributes:
                        ATTRIBUTE-NAME: !com.amazonaws.mobilehub.v0.ATTRIBUTE-VALUE
                    OTHER-FEATURE-PROPERTY-TYPES: OTHER-FEATURE-PROPERTY-VALUES
                . . .

The following YAML is a sample of the :file:`mobile-hub-project.yml` exported from a project with
many |AMH| features enabled. The project definition has also been manually updated to enable the
import and upload of components of the original project. These components include files stored in
the original project's User Data Storage bucket, files hosted in its Hosting and Streaming bucket,
and API handler code in its |LAM| functions.
