###################################
Add Authentication to the Notes App
###################################

In the :ref:`previous section <tutorial-ios-aws-mobile-notes-analytics>` of this tutorial, we created a mobile backend project in AWS Mobile Hub, then added analytics to the sample note-taking app. This section assumes you have completed those steps. If you jumped to this step, please go back and :ref:`start from
the beginning <tutorial-ios-aws-mobile-notes-setup>`. In this tutorial, we will configure a sign-up / sign-in flow in our mobile backend. We will then add a new authentication activity to our note-taking app.

You should be able to complete this section of the tutorial in 20-30 minutes.

Setup Your Backend
------------------

To add User Sign-in to your app you will create the backend resources in your |AMH| project, and then update the configuration file in your app.

Add User Sign-in to the AWS Mobile Hub Project
----------------------------------------------

#. Right-click :file:`awsconfiguration.json` in your Xcode Project Navigator, choose :guilabel:`Delete`, and then choose :guilabel:`Move to trash`.
#. Open the `AWS Mobile Hub console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/home/>`__.
#. Select your project.
#. Scroll down to the :guilabel:`Add More Backend Features` section.
#. Choose the :guilabel:`User Sign-in` tile.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Email and Password`.
#. Scroll to the bottom and then Choose :guilabel:`Create user pool`.

    .. list-table::
       :widths: 1 6

       * - What does this do?

         - You have just created your own user pool in the `Amazon Cognito <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html>`__ service. When used in conjunction with the AWS Mobile sign-in process, the user pool enforces the password requirement rules you chose. It also supports sign-up and forgot my password user flows.

#. Choose your project name in the upper left and then choose :guilabel:`Integrate` on your iOS app card.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Download Cloud Config` to get an  :file:`awsconfiguration.json` file updated with the new services.

    .. list-table::
       :widths: 1 6

       * - **Remember**

         - Whenever you update the AWS Mobile Hub project, a new AWS configuration file for your app is generated.


Connect to Your Backend
-----------------------

To update the linkage between your app and your AWS services:

#. Drag :file:`awsconfiguration.json` from your download location into the Xcode project folder containing :file:`Info.plist`. Select :guilabel:`Copy items if needed` and :guilabel:`Create groups` in the options dialog. Choose :guilabel:`Finish`.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 6

   * - **Note**

     - Your system may have modified the filename to avoid conflicts. Make sure the file you add to your Xcode project is named :file:`awsconfiguration.json`.

Add Auth Dependencies
---------------------

#. Add the following Auth dependencies in your project's :file:`Podfile`

   .. code-block:: bash

      platform :ios, '9.0'
      target :'MyNotes' do
          use_frameworks!

            # Analytics dependency
            pod 'AWSPinpoint', '~> 2.6.5'

            # Auth dependencies
            pod 'AWSUserPoolsSignIn', '~> 2.6.5'
            pod 'AWSAuthUI', '~> 2.6.5'
            pod 'AWSMobileClient', '~> 2.6.5'

          # other pods
      end

   Then, in a terminal run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pod install --repo-update


Create an AWSMobileClient and Initialize the SDK
------------------------------------------------

Import :code:`AWSMobileClient` and add the following function into the :code:`AppDelegate` class of :file:`AppDelegate.swift`. This will that an instance of :code:`AWSMobileClient`.

.. code-block:: swift

   import UIKit
   import CoreData

   // Anaytics imports
   import AWSCore
   import AWSPinpoint

   // Auth imports
   import AWSMobileClient

   @UIApplicationMain
   class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

                  // . . .

       //Instantiate the AWSMobileClient
       func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL,
           sourceApplication: String?, annotation: Any) -> Bool {

           return AWSMobileClient.sharedInstance().interceptApplication(
               application, open: url,
               sourceApplication: sourceApplication,
               annotation: annotation)

       }

                   // . . .
   }

In :code:`didFinishLaunching` call the :code:`AWSMobileClient` to register your user pool as the identity provider that enables users to access your app's AWS resources.

.. code-block:: swift

       func application(
           _ application: UIApplication,
               didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions:
                   [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

                   // . . .

        // Initialize AWSMobileClient
        return AWSMobileClient.sharedInstance().interceptApplication(
            application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:
            launchOptions)

        // Initialize Pinpoint to enable session analytics
        pinpoint = AWSPinpoint(configuration:
            AWSPinpointConfiguration.defaultPinpointConfiguration(
                launchOptions: launchOptions))

        return true
    }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 6

   * - What did this do?

     - This will register your sign in providers and fetch the user pool you created and fetch an identity that enables a user to access your app's AWS resources. In this case, the provider is an `Amazon Cognito user pool <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html>`__, but federating Facebook, Google, SAML and other identity providers is also supported.


Implement Your Sign-in UI
-------------------------

The AWS Mobile SDK provides a library that creates a customizable sign-in UI in your app. To create your sign-in UI, add the following imports and then call the library in the :code:`viewDidLoad()` function of :file:`MasterViewController.swift`
.

.. code-block:: swift

    import AWSCore
    import AWSPinpoint
    import UIKit
    import AWSAuthCore
    import AWSAuthUI

    class MasterViewController: UITableViewController, NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate {

               // . . .

        override func viewDidLoad() {
                super.viewDidLoad()

                // Instantiate sign-in UI from the SDK library
                if !AWSSignInManager.sharedInstance().isLoggedIn {
                    AWSAuthUIViewController
                        .presentViewController(with: self.navigationController!,
                             configuration: nil,
                             completionHandler: { (provider: AWSSignInProvider, error: Error?) in
                              if error != nil {
                                  print("Error occurred: \(String(describing: error))")
                              } else {
                                  // Sign in successful.
                              }
                        })
                }

               // . . .
          }
      }




Run the App and Validate Results
--------------------------------

Rebuild the project and run in the Simulator. You should see a sign-in
screen. Choose the :guilabel:`Create new account` button to create a new account.
Once the information is submitted, you will be sent a confirmation code
via email. Enter the confirmation code to complete registration, then
sign-in with your new account.

   * - **Tip**

     - Use Amazon WorkMail as a test email account

       If you do not want to use your own email account as a test account, create an
       `Amazon WorkMail <https://aws.amazon.com/workmail/>`__ service within AWS for test accounts. You can get started for free with a 30-day trial for up to 25 accounts.
