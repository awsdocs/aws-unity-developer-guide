   * - **BEFORE YOU BEGIN**

     - The steps on this page assume you have already completed the steps on :ref:`Get Started <web-getting-started>`.


The AWS Mobile CLI and Amplify library make it easy to create and call cloud APIs and their handler logic from your JavaScript.


Set Up Your Backend
===================

Create Your API
---------------

In the following examples you will create an API that is part of a cloud-enabled number guessing app. The CLI will create a serverless handler for the API behind the scenes.

**To enable and configure an API**

#. In the root folder of your app, run:

   .. code:: bash

        awsmobile cloud-api enable --prompt


#. When prompted, name the API :userinput:`Guesses`.

   .. code:: bash

        ? API name: Guesses

#. Name a HTTP path :userinput:`/number`. This maps to a method call in the API handler.

   .. code:: bash

      ? HTTP path name (/items): /number

#. Name your Lambda API handler function :userinput:`guesses`.

   .. code:: bash

        ? Lambda function name (This will be created if it does not already exists): guesses

#. When prompted to add another HTTP path, type :userinput:`N`.

   .. code:: bash

        ? Add another HTTP path (y/N): N

#. The configuration for your Guesses API is now saved locally. Push your configuration to the cloud.

   .. code:: bash

        awsmobile push

**To test your API and handler**

From the command line, run:

.. code:: bash

    awsmobile cloud-api invoke Guesses GET /number

The Cloud Logic API endpoint for the :code:`Guesses` API is now created.


Customize Your API Handler Logic
--------------------------------

The AWS Mobile CLI has generated a Lambda function to handle calls to the :code:`Guesses` API. It is saved locally in :file:`YOUR-APP-ROOT-FOLDER/awsmobilejs/backend/cloud-api/guesses`.  The :file:`app.js` file in that directory contains the definitions and functional code for all of the paths that are handled for your API.

**To customize your API handler**

#. Find the handler for POST requests on the :code:`/number` path. That line starts with :code:`app.post('number',`. Replace the callback function’s body with the following:

   .. code:: javascript

        # awsmobilejs/backend/cloud-api/guesses/app.js
        app.post('/number', function(req, res) {
          const correct = 12;
          let guess = req.body.guess
          let result = ""

          if (guess === correct) {
            result = "correct";
          } else if (guess > correct) {
            result = "high";
          } else if (guess < correct) {
            result = "low";
          }

          res.json({ result })
        });

#. Push your changes to the cloud.

   .. code:: bash

        awsmobile push

The :code:`Guesses` API handler logic that implements your new number guessing functionality is now deployed to the cloud.

Connect to Your Backend
=======================

The examples in this section show how you would integrate AWS Amplify library calls using React (see the `AWS Amplify documentation <https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/>`__ to use other flavors of Javascript).

The following simple component could be added to a :code:`create-react-app` project to present the number guessing game.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1

   * - .. code:: javascript

          // Number guessing game app example

          # src/GuessNumber.js

          class GuessNumber extends React.Component {
            state = { answer: null };

            render() {
              let prompt = ""
              const answer = this.state.answer

              switch (answer) {
                case "lower":
                  prompt = "Incorrect. Guess a lower number."
                case "higher":
                  prompt = "Incorrect. Guess a higher number."
                case "correct":
                  prompt = `Correct! The number is ${this.refs.guess.value}!`
                default:
                  prompt = "Guess a number between 1 and 100."
              }

              return (
                <div style={styles}>
                  <h1>Guess The Number</h1>
                  <p>{ prompt }</p>

                  <input ref="guess" type="text" />
                  <button type="submit">Guess</button>
                </div>
              )

            }
          }

          let styles = {
            margin: "0 auto",
            width: "30%"
          };

          export default GuessNumber;

Make a Guess
------------

The :code:`API` module from AWS Amplify allows you to send requests to your Cloud Logic APIs right from your JavaScript application.

**To make a RESTful API call**

#. Import the :code:`API` module from :code:`aws-amplify` in the :code:`GuessNumber` component file.

   .. code:: javascript

        import { API } from 'aws-amplify';

#. Add the :code:`makeGuess` function. This function uses the :code:`API` module’s :code:`post` function to submit a guess to the Cloud Logic API.

   .. code:: javascript

        async makeGuess() {
          const guess = parseInt(this.refs.guess.value);
          const body = { guess }
          const { result } = await API.post('Guesses', '/number', { body });
          this.setState({
            guess: result
          });
        }

#. Change the Guess button in the component’s :code:`render` function to invoke the :code:`makeGuess` function when it is chosen.

   .. code:: javascript

       <button type="submit" onClick={this.makeGuess.bind(this)}>Guess</button>

Open your app locally and test out guessing the number by running :code:`awsmobile run`.


Your entire component should look like the following:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1

   * - .. code:: javascript

          // Number guessing game app example

          import React from 'react';
          import { API } from 'aws-amplify';

          class GuessNumber extends React.Component {
            state = { guess: null };

            async makeGuess() {
              const guess = parseInt(this.refs.guess.value);
              const body = { guess }
              const { result } = await API.post('Guesses', '/number', { body });
              this.setState({
                guess: result
              });
            }

            render() {
              let prompt = ""

              switch (this.state.guess) {
                case "high":
                  prompt = "Incorrect. Guess a lower number.";
                  break;
                case "low":
                  prompt = "Incorrect. Guess a higher number.";
                  break;
                case "correct":
                  prompt = `Correct! The number is ${this.refs.guess.value}!`;
                  break;
                default:
                  prompt = "Guess a number between 1 and 100.";
              }

              return (
                <div style={styles}>
                  <h1>Guess The Number</h1>
                  <p>{ prompt }</p>

                  <input ref="guess" type="text" />
                  <button type="submit" onPress={this.makeGuess.bind(this)}>Guess</button>
                </div>
              )

            }
          }

          let styles = {
            margin: "0 auto",
            width: "30%"
          };

          export default GuessNumber;
