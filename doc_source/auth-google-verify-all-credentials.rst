Verify All Platform Client IDs
#################################


If your app supports both Android and iOS platforms, then your app project in the Google Developers
Console will now have three client IDs: one for web application, one for Android, and one for iOS.
You can verify that you have all of the credentials for all of the platforms by looking at the
:guilabel:`Credentials` panel in the API Manager for your app, as shown in the following.
