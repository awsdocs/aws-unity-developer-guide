.. _web-getting-started_overview:

Overview
========

The AWS Mobile CLI provides a command line experience that allows frontend JavaScript developers to quickly create and integrate AWS backend resources into their mobile apps.

.. _web-getting-started_prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

#. `Sign up for the AWS Free Tier <https://aws.amazon.com/free/>`__.

#. Install `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`__ with NPM.

#. Install AWS Mobile CLI

   .. code-block:: bash

       npm install -g awsmobile-cli

#. Configure the CLI with your AWS credentials

   To setup permissions for the toolchain used by the CLI, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      awsmobile configure

   If prompted for credentials, follow the steps provided by the CLI. For more information, see :ref:`provide IAM credentials to AWS Mobile CLI <aws-mobile-cli-credentials>`.


.. _web-getting-started-create-or-integrate:

Set Up Your Backend
===================

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1

   * - Need to create a quick sample React app? See `Create a React App <https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html>`__.


**To configure backend features for your app**

#. In the root folder of your app, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

        awsmobile init

   The :code:`init` command creates a backend project for your app. By default, analytics and web hosting are enabled in your backend and this configuration is automatically pulled into your app when you initialize.

#. When prompted, provide the source directory for your project. The CLI will generate :file:`aws-exports.js` in this location. This file contains the configuration and endpoint metadata used to link your frontend to your backend services.

   .. code-block:: bash

      ? Where is your project's source directory:  src

#. Respond to further prompts with the following values.

   .. code-block:: bash

      ? Where is your project's distribution directory to store build artifacts:  dist
      ? What is your project's build command:  npm run-script build
      ? What is your project's start command for local test run:  npm run-script start
      ? What awsmobile project name would you like to use:  YOUR-APP-NAME-2017-11-10-15-17-48

After the project is created you will get a success message which also includes details on the path where the aws-exports.js is copied.

    .. code-block:: bash

        awsmobile project's details logged at: awsmobilejs/#current-backend-info/backend-details.json
        awsmobile project's access information logged at: awsmobilejs/#current-backend-info/aws-exports.js
        awsmobile project's access information copied to: src/aws-exports.js
        awsmobile project's specifications logged at: awsmobilejs/#current-backend-info/mobile-hub-project.yml
        contents in #current-backend-info/ is synchronized with the latest information in the aws cloud

Your project is now initialized.


â€¨.. _web-getting-started-configure-aws-amplify:

Connect to Your Backend
=======================

AWS Mobile uses the open source `AWS Amplify library <https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify>`__ to link your code to the AWS features configured for your app.


This section of the guide shows examples using a React application of the kind output by :code:`create-react-app` or a similar tool.

**To connect the app to your configured AWS features**

In :file:`index.js` (or in other code that runs at launch-time), add the following imports.

.. code-block:: javascript

    import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
    import aws_exports from './YOUR-PATH-TO/aws-exports';

Then add the following code.

.. code-block:: javascript

    Amplify.configure(aws_exports);


Run Your App Locally
--------------------

Your app is now ready to launch and use the default features configured by AWS Mobile.

**To launch your app locally in a browser**

In the root folder of your app, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    awsmobile run

Behind the scenes, this command runs :code:`npm install` to install the Amplify library and also pushes any backend configuration changes to AWS Mobile. To run your app locally without pushing backend changes you cou can choose to run :code:`npm install` and then run :code:`npm start`.

Anytime you launch your app, :ref:`app analytics are gathered and can be visualized<web-add-analytics>` in an AWS console.

   * - AWS Free Tier

     - Initializing your app or adding features through the CLI will cause AWS services to be configured on your behalf. The `pricing for AWS Mobile services <http://aws.amazon.com/mobile/pricing>`__ enables you to learn and prototype at little or no cost using the `AWS Free Tier <http://aws.amazon.com/free>`__.


.. _web-getting-started-deploying-and-testing:

Next Steps
==========

   :local:
   :depth: 1

Deploy your app to the cloud
----------------------------

Using a simple command, you can publish your app's frontend to hosting on a robust content distribution network (CDN) and view it in a browser.

**To deploy your app to the cloud and launch it in a browser**

In the root folder of your app, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    awsmobile publish

To push any backend configuration changes to AWS and view content locally, run :code:`awsmobile run`. In both cases, any pending changes you made to your backend configuration are made to your backend resources.

By default, the CLI configures AWS Mobile :ref:`Hosting and Streaming <hosting-and-streaming>` feature, that hosts your app on `Amazon CloudFront <https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/>`__ CDN endpoints. These locations make your app highly available to the public on the Internet and support `media file streaming <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile-hub/latest/developerguide/url-cf-dev;Tutorials.html>`__

You can also :ref:`use a custom domain <web-host-frontend>` for your hosting location.

Test Your App on Our Mobile Devices
-----------------------------------

Invoke a free remote test of your app on a variety of real devices and see results, including screen shots.

**To invoke a remote test of your app**

In the root folder of your app, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    awsmobile publish --test

The CLI will open the reporting page for your app in the |AMH| console to show the metrics gathered from the test devices. The device that runs the remote test you invoke resides in `AWS Device Farm <https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/>`__ which provides flexible configuration of tests and reporting.
