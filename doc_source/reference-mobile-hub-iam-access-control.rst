############################################################
Overview of Access Permissions Management for |AMH| Projects
############################################################

In depth understanding of AWS authentication and access controls is not required to build a mobile
app using |AMHlong|.

Every AWS resource is owned by an AWS account, and permissions to create or access the resources are
governed by permissions policies. This includes:


* Policies for :ref:`reference-mobile-hub-iam-managed-policies`.

* AWS :ref:`reference-mobile-hub-iam-service-role` to create and configure the back-end features you select for
  your mobile app.

An account administrator can attach permissions policies to |IAM| identities (that is, users,
groups, and roles), and some services (such as |LAMlong|) also support attaching permissions
policies to resources.

.. note:: An :emphasis:`account administrator` (or administrator user) is a user with administrator
   privileges. For more information, see `IAM Best Practices <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html>`__ in the
   :title:`IAM User Guide`.

   When granting permissions, you decide who is getting the permissions, the resources they get
   permissions for, and the specific actions that you want to allow on those resources.

.. _resource-ownership:

Understanding Resource Ownership for |AMHlong|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The primary resource of a |AMH| project is the project itself. In first use of the |AMH| console,
you allow |AMH| to manage permissions and access the project resource for you. A resource owner is
the AWS account that created a resource. That is, the resource owner is the AWS account of the
principal entity (the root account, an |IAM| user, or an |IAM| role) that authenticates the request
that creates the resource. The following examples illustrate how this works:


* If you use the root account credentials of your AWS account to create an |AMHlong| project, your
  AWS account is the owner of the resources associated with that project.

* If you create an |IAM| user in your AWS account and grant permissions to create |AMH| projects to
  that user, the user can also create projects. However, your AWS account, to which the user
  belongs, owns the resources associated with the project.

* If you create an |IAM| role in your AWS account with permissions to create |AMHlong| projects,
  anyone who can assume the role can create, edit, or delete projects. Your AWS account, to which
  the role belongs, owns the resources associated with that project.


.. _managing-access:

Managing Access to Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


A :emphasis:`permissions policy` describes who has access to what. The following section explains
the available options for creating permissions policies.

.. note::

   This section discusses using |IAM| in the context of |AMHlong|. It doesn't provide
   detailed information about the |IAM| service. For complete |IAM| documentation, see
   `What Is IAM? <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html>`__
   in the :title:`IAM User Guide`. For information about |IAM|
   policy syntax and descriptions, see `AWS Identity and Access Management Policy Reference
   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html>`__ in the :title:`IAM User Guide`.

Policies attached to an |IAM| identity are referred to as identity-based policies (|IAM| polices)
and policies attached to a resource are referred to as resource-based policies.

.. _identity-based-policies:

Identity-Based Policies (|IAM| Policies)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


You can attach policies to |IAM| identities. For example, you can do the following:


* **Attach a permissions policy to a user or a group in your account**? An account
  administrator can use a permissions policy that is associated with a particular user to grant
  permissions for that user to view or modify an |AMHlong| project.

* **Attach a permissions policy to a role (grant cross-account permissions)** ? You can
  attach an identity-based permissions policy to an |IAM| role to grant cross-account permissions.
  For example, when you first enter |AMH| and agree, as account principal, to grant it permissions
  to provision and configure your project, you are granting the AWS managed
  :code:`MobileHub_Service_Role` role cross-account permissions. An AWS managed policy,
  :code:`AWSMobileHub_ServiceUseOnly`, is attached to that role in the context of your |AMH|
  project. The role has a trust policy that allows |AMH| to act as account principal with the
  ability to grant permissions for services and resources used by your project.

  For more information about using |IAM| to delegate permissions, see `Access Management
  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html>`__ in the :title:`IAM User Guide`.

As an example of using an identity-based policy, the following policy grants permissions to a user
to create an |S3| bucket. A user with these permissions can create a storage location using the |S3|
service.

.. code-block:: json

    {
           "Version":"2012-10-17",
           "Statement":[
              {
                 "Effect":"Allow",
                 "Action":"s3:CreateBucket*",
                 "Resource":"*"
              }
           ]
        }

For more information about using identity-based policies with |AMH| , see :ref:`reference-mobile-hub-iam-managed-policies`
and :ref:`reference-mobile-hub-iam-service-role`.

For more information about users, groups, roles, and permissions, see `Identities (Users, Groups,
and Roles) <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html>`__ in the :title:`IAM User Guide`.


.. _resource-based-policies:

Resource-Based Policies
"""""""""""""""""""""""


Other services, such as |S3|, also support resource-based permissions policies. For example, you can
attach a policy to an |S3| bucket to manage access permissions to that bucket.



.. _policy-elements:

Specifying Policy Elements: Actions, Effects, Resources, and Principals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Each service that is configured by |AMH| defines a set of API operations. To grant |AMH| permissions
for these API operations, a set of actions is specified in an AWS managed policy. Performing an API
operation can require permissions for more than one action.

The following are the basic policy elements:


* **Resource** - In a policy, you use an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to identify the resource
  to which the policy applies.

* **Action** - You use action keywords to identify resource operations that you want to
  allow or deny. For example, the :code:`s3:Createbucket` permission allows |AMH| to perform the
  |S3| :code:`CreateBucket` operation.

* **Effect** - You specify the effect when the user requests the specific action?this can be
  either allow or deny. If you don't explicitly grant access to (allow) a resource, access is
  implicitly denied. You can also explicitly deny access to a resource, which you might do to make
  sure that a user cannot access it, even if a different policy grants access.

* **Principal** - In identity-based policies (|IAM| policies), the user that the policy is
  attached to is the implicit principal. For resource-based policies, you specify the user, account,
  service, or other entity that you want to receive permissions (applies to resource-based policies
  only).
