Android: Sync Data with Amazon Cognito Sync
###########################################


Overview
--------

|COG| Sync is an AWS service and client library that enables cross-device syncing of
application-related user data. You can use the |COG| Sync API to synchronize user profile data
across devices and across login providers |mdash| Amazon, Facebook, Twitter/Digits, Google, and your
own custom identity provider.

For instructions on how to integrate Amazon Cognito Sync in your application, see  `Amazon Cognito
Sync Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/devguide/sync/>`__.


Set Up the SDK
--------------

You must complete all of the instructions on the :doc:`how-to-android-sdk-setup` page before beginning
this tutorial.


Initialize the CognitoSyncManager
---------------------------------

Pass your initialized Amazon Cognito credentials provider to the :code:`CognitoSyncManager` constructor.

.. code-block:: java

    CognitoSyncManager client = new CognitoSyncManager(
        getApplicationContext(),
        Regions.YOUR_REGION,
        credentialsProvider);

For more information about Cognito Identity, see :doc:`cognito-auth-legacy`.


Syncing User Data
-----------------

To sync unauthenticated user data:

#. Create a dataset and add user data.
#. Synchronize the dataset with the cloud.


Create a Dataset and Add User Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create an instance of :code:`Dataset`. User data is added in the form of key/value pairs. Dataset
objects are created with the :code:`CognitoSyncManager` class which functions as a Cognito client
object. Use the defaultCognito method to get a reference to the instance of CognitoSyncManager. The
openOrCreateDataset method is used to create a new dataset or open an existing instance of a dataset
stored locally on the device.

.. code-block:: java

    Dataset dataset = client.openOrCreateDataset("datasetname");

Cognito datasets function as dictionaries, with values accessible by key::

.. code-block:: java

    String value = dataset.get("myKey");
    dataset.put("myKey", "my value");


Synchronize Dataset with the Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To synchronize a dataset, call its synchronize method.

.. code-block:: java

    dataset.synchronize();

All data written to datasets will be stored locally until the dataset is synced. The code in this
section assumes you are using an unauthenticated Cognito identity, so when the user data is synced
with the cloud it will be stored per device. The device has a device ID associated with it. When the
user data is synced to the cloud, it will be associated with that device ID.

To sync user data across devices (using an authenticated identity), see `Amazon Cognito Sync
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/devguide/sync/>`__.
